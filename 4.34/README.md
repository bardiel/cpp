# Factorial

The factorial of a nonnegative integer n is written n! (pronounced “n factorial”) and is defined as follows:

	n! = n · (n – 1) · (n – 2) · ... · 1 (for values of n greater than 1)

and 

	n! = 1 (for n = 0 or n = 1)

For example, 5! = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1, which is 120. Use while statements in each of the following:

1 Write a program that reads a nonnegative integer and computes and prints its factorial.
2 Write a program that estimates the value of the mathematical constant e by using the

formula:

	e = 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ...

Prompt the user for the desired accuracy of e (i.e., the number of terms in the summation).

3 Write a program that computes the value of e x by using the formula

	e = x/1! + x²/2! + x³/3! + ...

Prompt the user for the desired accuracy of e (i.e., the number of terms in the summation).
